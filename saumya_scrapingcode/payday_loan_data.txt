As of that law, borrowers were not obligated to pay back loans  to such lenders and any collection activities in such cases were  rendered illegal.

History of Payday Loans:
1990’s: – Payday lending started as an industry in California as an extension of the check cashing industry. At that time there wasn’t any special state law that explicitly authorized or prohibited check cashers from offering high-interest payday loans and they were not specifically regulated by the California Finance Lenders Law. Thus, they worked freely. (Report on the Status of Payday Lending in California)
1996: – “SB 1959(C. Calderon, Statutes of ) sanctioned and accepted the requirements for a payday loan in California law. The bill exempted check cashers from the California Finance Lenders Law, which officially allowed payday lenders to charge excessive interest rates. (California Budget Project Chartbook 2008) The loan terms set by this law haven’t changed much for almost 20  years:  15% limit on fees, ~400% APR, $300 max loan amount. (Report on the Status of Payday Lending in California)
2002: – TheCalifornia Deferred Deposit Transaction Lawwas introduced. It is now considered as one of the most ambiguous laws that do not take into account the consumers’ interests. It “established both licensure and regulation of persons making deferred deposit transactions”by imposing licensing obligations and disclosure all the lending terms among other things. Loan terms, however, didn’t become more restrictive.
2000s – nowadays: –All the billsthat came before the Legislature to regulate payday lending industry in the state, unfortunately,died. Among manyfailed attemptswere:SB 365(2011, died in committee) aimed at creating a payday loan database.SB 515(2014, died in committee) aimed to extend the minimum payday loan term and require lenders to offer installments.AB 2953(2018, died in the Senate) proposed a 36% interest rate cap on auto-title loans.AB 2500(2018, died on the Assembly floor) proposed a 36% interest rate cap on installment loans.AB 3010(2018, died) aimed to restrict payday loans to 1 at a time and proposed creating a database where lenders would record all loan transactions.

Sess. (Cal.  2004); Cal. Fin. Code § 23057.), and the law that exempts auto dealers from coverage (AB 634, 2007-2008 Leg. Sess. (Cal. 2008); Cal. Fin. Code §  23001.)

History of Payday Loans:
Before 1980s: – Nevada had a usury cap of 18% APR for all small loans, thus, no payday lenders were to be found in the state.
1984: – Nevada abolished the 18% APR usury cap and by doing so it welcomed the payday loan industry into the state.
2005: –NRS Chapter 604A, a new Nevada statute, was enacted. It became the first law that actually regulated certain types of high interest loans.
2006: – TheMilitary Lending Acteffectively capped payday loans offered to the military at 36% APR.  This federal law has no exceptions, thus, no lender in Nevada is now  allowed to offer loans to the military in excess of 36% APR.
2007: – The term “high interest loans”  was added into the statute in order to be specifically regulated  thereby. The legislation stayed the same for years since that time.
2016: – It is reported that  the industry donated large sums to the state lawmakers in order to rule  out any attempts to restrict the industry regulations. And regardless of  the laws that came into effect years earlier, payday lenders still  thrived. One bill was proposed to limit the number of outstanding loans,  to set a “cooling-off” period between loans, and to create a statewide  lender database; however, it never came to life.
June 2, 2016: – TheConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)proposed aPayday Loan Rulethat hasn’t yet fully come into effect (expected in November 2020).
2017: –AB 163was enacted. This time, Nevada decided not to wait for the federal  decision, and the state legislature managed to introduce a change into  payday loan regulations. Now payday lenders are forced to check whether a  prospective borrower is able to repay a loan before giving approval. It  might not seem much (the overall payday loan situation in the state  considered) but it is a start.
2019: – theSB201bill was adopted, according to whicha special baseshould be created to control the number of loans issued. According to the new requirements, the lender must check the information about the client in the database before issuing a loan.

Thenew set of ruleslimited the maximum loan amount to $1,000 (or 25% of a borrower’s gross  monthly income). Also, the bill’s another provision limited the number  of times a lender can attempt to cash a borrower’s check to 2. An  extended payment plan now became a requirement and it can be requested  by the borrower without any added fees. Now the borrowers are able to  dividing the loan into 4 installments to repay the loan in the course of  the following 12 months.
June 2, 2016: – TheConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)proposed aPayday Loan Rulethat hasn’t yet fully come into effect (expected in November 2020).
2019: – Current situation  with regard to payday loan regulations stays the same. Since 2014, when  the Legislature passed a bill with the number of limitations, the number  of registered payday lenders in Idaho slightly dropped (2016 – 174,  2018 – 154). However, the rates are still the same and they are still  high. Also, the Idaho Department of Finance has been receiving an  increased number of consumer complaints (5 times more since 2016) due to  the fact that many customers don’t understand the loan terms. So, the  problem is still here.

State: New Mexico
========================================

Payday Loan Regulations:
Legal Status: Prohibited
Restrictions: 175% small loan cap

History of Payday Loans:
1916: – Many states adopted some form of theUniform Small Loan Lawsthat introduced a 2% or 3% small loan interest rate cap per month. Yet,  things were different with New Mexico. Its small loan legislation was enacted in 1939 and it presupposed a 12% APR cap on unsecured loans.
1978: – The Supreme Court made a decision to repeal the aforementioned caps in order to make more room for the operation of the banks in their states. So did New Mexico in the period between 1981 and  1991, and by doing so it allowed the payday lending industry to grow and flourish in the 1990s.
2006: – TheMilitary Lending Acteffectively capped payday loans offered to the military at 36% APR.  This federal law has no exceptions, thus, no lender in New Mexico is now allowed to offer loans to the military in excess of 36% APR.
2007: – The Payday Loan Reform Law was enacted by the  New Mexico Legislature. The new reform allowed triple-digit interest payday loans. It set loan amount and term limits (not exceeding $2500 or  25% of a person’s gross monthly income, no later than 35 days) and introduced the loan database. These provisions were in place for years,  however, they were not effective enough to stop lenders from finding loopholes in the law and going on with their expensive loan practices.
June 2, 2016: – TheConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)proposed aPayday Loan Rulethat hasn’t yet fully come into effect (expected in November 2020).
2017: – New Mexico decided not to wait for the federal decision and took its own measures.HB 347was passed and it enacted the first statutory rate cap on payday loans.  The new law now allows not more than 175% APR on small loans under  $5,000, sets the loan term of 120 days at least, and requires arepayment planwith at least 4 equal payments. This bill amended the New  Mexico Small Loan Act (1955), the New Mexico Bank Installment Loan Act  (1959), and the Money, Interest, and Usury statute. It made the payday loan business both impossible and unprofitable in New Mexico.
- Yet,  the bill as the state Legislature’s step to protect customers is not considered sufficient (especially by the industry opponents who proposed a radical 36% APR cap), however, considering the previous situation, it is better than nothing.

History of Payday Loans:
2000s: – Payday lending was legal in the state and lenders could charge high-interest rates.
2006: – TheMilitary Lending Acteffectively capped payday loans offered to the military at 36% APR.  This federal law has no exceptions, thus, no lender in Colorado is now  allowed to offer loans to the military at the excess of 36% APR.
2007: – The law that  attempted to reform the payday lending industry was made, however, that  attempt failed. Lenders continued to make lump-sum high-cost loans but  were then required to offer an installment plan as well. Yet, in all  aspects, thereform was unsuccessful.
2010: – Colorado enacted new  legislation that required all loans to be repaid at lower rates by  introducing affordable installment payments as a must.
June 2, 2016: – The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed aPayday Loan Rulethat hasn’t yet fully come into effect (expected in November 2020).
- And while the fate of the federal regulation is still unclear, the state took their own measures meanwhile.
November 6, 2018: – Colorado Legislature approved aballot initiative,  which is officially referred to as Proposition 111. It amends  Colorado’s Deferred Deposit Loan Act and reduces deferred deposit loans  interest rates and fees to 36%. Also, the Preposition 111 puts a stop to  any alternative APRs, origination and/or monthly maintenance fees, and  has other provisions with regard to payday loans. The measure took  effectFebruary 1, 2019.
- The  new law doesn’t exactly outlaw payday lenders, however, the cap it  places is very likely to drive most of them away from the state as such  terms render the business entirely unprofitable.
July 1, 2024: Colorado passes law capping consumer loan rates at 36% for out-of-state banks, effective. Applies to new/renewed loans, raising enforceability questions.

History of Payday Loans:
1994: – First time when payday loans were introduced in the state.
2000: –LB 932allowed lenders to hold checks longer than 31 days in case they were “not negotiable” (couldn’t be cashed).
2006: –LB 876was passed. It extended the loan terms to 34 days. It also prohibited roll-overs.
2006: – TheMilitary Lending Acteffectively capped payday loans offered to the military at 36% APR.  This federal law has no exceptions, thus, no lender in Nebraska is now allowed to offer loans to the military in excess of 36% APR.
June 2, 2016 – The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed a Payday Loan Rule that hasn’t come into effect.: 
- 2016 – There was an attempt (LB 1036) to set a limit to the payday loan APR to 36%; however, this effort came to nothing.
- April 19, 2018 – LB 194  passed unanimously by the state Legislature and was approved by the  Governor. It didn’t restrict either the loan amount or rates, however,  it closed a loophole that payday lenders used to get around regulatory limits, imposed reporting requirements on payday lenders, and also imposed a requirement to provide a short payment plan for borrowers.
- Taking into account that the Nebraska Department of Banking and Commerce had to deal with more than300 enforcement actionsagainst payday lenders for various violations since 2006, it is likely thatLB 194will be followed by other restrictive laws in the nearest future.
November 3, 2020 –(Initiative 428); Annual interest rate was limited to 36%, loan amount – to $500, loan term to 34 days.: Before the new law ARP was %404, fee was $15 for the every $100 loan.

History of Payday Loans:
1991: – The first time whenKansas Legislature paid attentionto the issue of payday loans and sensed the need for their regulations.  At that time check cashing for a fee had prevailed in Kansas. It also  appeared that the practice itself violated the Uniform Consumer Credit  Code (UCCC) as lenders advanced cash in return for the post-dated checks  and collected high-interest charges for it (600% – 1,600%). Thus,SB 363was introduced. It aimed to address the issue of excessive interest rates, however, it never made it to out of the Senate.
1992: – Review of theSB 363.HB 2749was also reviewed, however, to no avail again.
1993: – Finally,HB 2197was passed by both the House and Senate. It enacted new consumer  protections on payday loans, set limits to loan amount, loan terms and  finance charges. As a matter of fact, Kansas was among the first states  that enacted payday loan regulations.

History of Payday Loans:
2003 –: The Oklahoma Legislatureauthorized payday lending. According to the Oklahoma Deferred Deposit Lending Act (2003, amended in 2004), 2 outstanding payday loans at the time are allowed for 12 – 45 days with the maximum total amount of $500. Basically, all the loan terms stayed more or less the same for years.
July 1, 2004: – All licensed payday lenders must record every Oklahoma payday loan in the Oklahoma Department of Consumer Credit database and check it every time before issuing new loans.
2006: – TheMilitary Lending Acteffectively capped payday loans offered to the military at 36% APR. This federal law has no exceptions, thus, no lender in Oklahoma is now allowed to offer loans to the military in excess of 36% APR.
- However, theDemographics of Payday Lending in Oklahomareport found out some years later after the MLA came into effect that“most of the payday lenders (199 out of 324) in Oklahoma are located within 10-mile radius of military installations and base.”And this is definitely saying something about the law-abiding nature of Oklahoma payday lenders, we assume.
2012: –Bill 1082was signed, according to which information from the payday lending database is confidential.
2013: – There were 358 licensed payday lending stores in Oklahoma according to the Center for Responsible Lending report.
June 2, 2016: – TheConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)proposed aPayday Loan Rulethat hasn’t yet fully come into effect (the federal rule is expected in November 2020).
2017: – Yet, they managed to stop some of the “beneficial” high-cost products from appearing in Oklahoma. There was anunsuccessfulattempt on the part of the lenders to add “installment loans” to the Oklahoma market ($1,500 maximum amount, a 12-month term, 17% monthly interest). However, Governor Mary Fallin put avetoonHB 1913.
April 18, 2019: –SB 720was signed (creation ofSmall Lenders Act): all small loans from all lenders for one borrower cannot exceed $1,500; all charges (interest rate) should not be more than 17% per month.

History of Payday Loans:
1939: – Minnesota passed the Small Loan Act. By doing so, it put a start to licensed lending in the state and gave way to loans up to $300 (under 3% monthly interest.)
1995: – Minnesota passedStat. § 47.60 et seq.(the Consumer Small Loan Lender Act) and payday lending became legal in the state. It capped the loan amount at $350.
2006: – TheMilitary Lending Acteffectively capped payday loans offered to the military at 36% APR. This federal law has no exceptions, thus, no lender in Minnesota is now allowed to offer loans to the military in excess of 36% APR.
1999 – 2012: – The tricky thing about Minnesota law is that a payday lender can apply for an industrial loan and thrift company license (under Chapter 53 ofStat. § 47.60 et seq.) By doing so, lenders can offer loans in excess of $350 and sell open-ended loans, get around roll-over restrictions and other terms and requirements. Many lenders followed this route, and thus, there is no surprise that payday lending became a huge industry in the state and managed to collect as much as $12 million in fees (in the above mentioned period).
2014: – A bill that would have capped the number of loans borrowers can takedidn’t pass.
June 2, 2016: – TheConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)proposed aPayday Loan Rulethat hasn’t yet fully come into effect (expected in November 2020).
Present days: – There have been many attempts on the part of payday lenders to get around the law in Minnesota, however, many of these attempts have been successfully opposed by theMinnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson. Currently, no new regulations are expected in the nearest future.

History of Payday Loans:
Since: 1998– For years Iowa has been quite lenient when it came to payday loans. Payday lenders could chargeany maximum fee in 1998, 2001, and 2004. Also, an effective maximum APR on 14-day 100$ loan in Iowa increased from 391% in 1998 to 435% in 2004. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, it was one of 27 “permissive” states in 2012 that allowed payday lending with minimal regulations.

History of Payday Loans:
1930s: – The first payday loans in Missouri can be traced. In order to avoid complying with the usury laws, lenders began issuing short-term loans with post-dated checks as collateral.
1980s: – Interest rate limits on payday lenders were placed by the state. However, they seized being effective in 1998.
1998: – The Missouri Legislature eliminated the usury cap altogether and by doing so gave payday lenders the freedom to charge whatever interest they wanted (actually, legally).
2001: – A performance audit of the payday loan industry (issued by Missouri Auditor Claire McCaskill) revealed the lack of interest rate caps. According to the audit, the average APR for a payday loan was 391%. Out of good intentions, McCaskill recommended introducing a cap on the number of loan renewals for a customer. No offer to cap interest rates was proposed, however.
- Eventually, the Missouri Legislature came up with the law that only made the situation worse as it “capped” fees and interest at 75% of the principal amount of the loan. This “limitation” led to ~1950% APR on a 2-week loan, the highest allowed in the country.
2006: – TheMilitary Lending Acteffectively capped payday loans offered to the military at 36% APR. No lender in Missouri is now allowed to offer loans to the military in excess of 36% APR.
June 2, 2016: – TheConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)proposed aPayday Loan Rulethat hasn’t yet fully come into effect (the federal rule is expected in November 2020).
- There were attempts to change the situation on the state level (i.e. HB2657 that suggested capping fees and interest at 35% of the amount of a loan). It died.
2018 – Nowadays: – Thus, despite the above mentioned federal regulations, there has been no change in legislation in Missouri for the payday lending Industry for 2018.
- The current situation is not the same, however, as it was in the 2000s: compared to 1,335 licensed lenders operating in the state in 2005, there were 653 in 2017, which shows a somewhat declining trend in the industry. To a certain extent, it was caused by a shift to a different type of loans – installment loans. Also, the decrease can be explained by the fact that the elimination of usury cap in 2002 lead to the oversupply of stores and too many appeared in the state. Now, however, there is no need in such numbers, so, they shrink. Nevertheless, the use of payday loans in Missouri is still twice the national average.

History of Payday Loans:
Before 2010: – Wisconsin is a unique state of sorts. It was the last in the country to introduce payday loan regulations with regard to the amount and the APR.

History of Payday Loans:
1973: – The Indiana State Legislature got its version of the Consumer Credit Protection Act in the form of Ind. Code §35-45-7. It introduced theusury cap of 72% APR(two times the ratespecified in IC 24-4.5-3-508(2)(a)(i)) and requested lenders to comply with it. Charging the rates in excess of this limit would be considered“loansharking, a Level 6 felony.”
1990s: – First payday loans appeared in the state of Indiana.
1993: – The Indiana Department of Financial Institutions was created. It regulates traditional banks and small lenders, and also, the payday lending industry. However, payday lenders continued to grow in numbers, flourish, and charge 391%APR in Indiana regardless of the aforementioned usury cap.
2002: – All thanks to the new legislation introduced by the Indiana General Assembly thatexempted payday lenders from the 36% APR cap. Such a move officially allowed payday lenders to charge at their discretion.
2006: – TheMilitary Lending Acteffectively capped payday loans offered to the military at 36% APR. This federal law has no exceptions, thus, no lender in Indiana is now allowed to offer loans to the military in excess of 36% APR.
2000 – Nowadays: –Code Ann. § 24-4.5-7-101 et seq.(its key terms are mentioned earlier in the text)currently regulatesthe activity of payday lending companies in the state.
2013: – According to theCenter for Responsible Lendingreport, 4,220 loans were taken in Indiana, with an average of $317.
2015: – There were35 active licensed lendersin Indiana.
June 2, 2016: – TheConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)proposed aPayday Loan Rulethat hasn’t yet fully come into effect.
- However, it is more and more unlikely that the rule will ever come into effect and not without Indiana’s assistance: a specific bill in the U.S. Senate that would enact many previous regulations is actually being co-sponsored by an Indiana senator.
2018: –SB 245was intended to raise the minimum amount of a loan, itfailedto pass into the Senate.
2018: –SB 325was intended to raise the loan limits to $605 and $1,500, respectively, increase the loan term from 90 days to 12 months and allow APR of up to 222%. The bill passed the Indiana House, however, itdiedin the Indiana Senate.
2019: – Another bill,SB 104, was intended to cap payday loan APRs at 36%, however, it was voted down.
April 2019: – The most recent bill,SB 613, passed the Senate butdiedin the House. It would permit two new types of loans. These loans include those whose amounts are $605 up to $1,500 and whose loan life ranges from six months to 12 months. The APR of these loans is up to 192%.
- Thus, as of today, the situation stays the same. However, Indiana is one of the states where payday lenders do make a stir and are not ready to give up easily.

History of Payday Loans:
Before the 1990s: – Ohio law prohibited payday loans for more than 50 years.
1995: – ThePay Day Loan Actwas approved by the Legislature in Ohio; it presupposed state licensing of payday lenders and also exempted payday lenders from the state’s usury laws. Payday lending stores opened for business in Ohio and soon the industry grew and flourished charging triple-digit ARP.
1997: – Some banks, e.g. Wells Fargo, started offering expensive “deposit advance” loans against the next paychecks of the customers.
2000: – Ohio prohibited any court actions against customers where payday lenders could use the Civil Damages for Crime Victims law.
- Lenders were requested to disclose all the loan terms (APR, primarily) under the Truth in Lending Act. The measure was actively opposed by the lenders.
2002 – 2004: – A rent-a-bank scheme was very popular, however, finally, the FDIC put a stop to bank-payday partnerships.
2004: – The rise of Internet loans (as a new way to evade state usury laws). (Clevelend.com)
2007: – The number of a payday loan stores was raised from 107 (in the 1996 year) to 1638 locations.
2008: – Ohio enacted theShort-Term Lender Law (“STLA”). TheOhio Short-Term Loan Actcapped the interest at 28% and imposed a $500 restriction on payday loans.However, due to the possibility for payday lenders to register as mortgage lenders underOhio’s Mortgage Lending Act (MLA)no lenders obtained licenses under theShort-Term Loan Act.MLAhas a 25% interest rate cap, but none of the other STLA restrictions. Here, payday lenders managed to evade the regulations again, this time by registering as credit services organizations (according to the newly-createdCredit Service Organizations Act). Hence, the exorbitant interest rates, again.

History of Payday Loans:
1992: – Kentucky legislature passedHB 747which enacted KRS Chapter 368. According to this bill, all check cashing businesses had to to be licensed by the Department of Financial Institutions(DFI). The bill had no mentioning of deferred deposit transactions at that time, however, allowed check cashers to charge some unspecified fee that wasn’t considered interest.
1992-1998: – Deferred deposit businesses were added to HB 747. They grew in numbers and flourished offering deferred deposit transactions without any interest rate or fee caps.
1998: –HB 266was passed by Kentucky legislature. Deferred deposit transactions appeared the part of the check cashing statute, KRS Chapter 368 and, thus, capped the “service fees” at $15 per $100.
1999: – Supreme Court of Kentucky found out that before 1998 all deferred deposit businesses were not supposed to be exempt from the state usury laws (which sort of made all the past transactions illegal?)
2006: – TheMilitary Lending Acteffectively capped payday loans offered to the military at 36% APR. This federal law has no exceptions, thus, no lender in Kentucky is now allowed to offer loans to the military in excess of 36% APR.
2009: – The Kentucky Legislature passed a payday loan law that introduced a 2-loan limit with a $500 total. Also, the10-year moratorium on new check cashersbegan July 1. The new licenses were not to be issued since that time. Current licenses were transfer-able or assignable, subject to approval by DFI.
2010: – Astatewide database, theKentucky Deferred Presentment Transaction System, was added as one of the amendments of the payday loan law. It was intended to enforce the aforementioned limitation. The fees and charges stayed the same. Yet, according to the2014 report, A reform from  poses a gap in which payday loan borrowers may take out no more than 52 loans per calendar year, under Kentucky law.
2014: – There was another attempt to pass a more restrictive bill on payday loan (Kentucky Senate Bill 32). It was presupposed to introduce an interest cap for payday loans that would prohibit charging more than 36% of the total borrowed amount. This bill was discussed in the Kentucky House of Representatives as well and it failed to pass in the House Banking and Insurance Committee. Provided that the legislation had passed, Kentucky would have joined 18 other states (DC including) that have already had the law in action.

permanent: Initially, the new law only presupposed to set apart the licenses for check-cashing businesses and deferred deposit businesses (payday lenders). However, the bill’s amendment put a full stop to any new  deferred deposit licenses. In other words, a temporary moratorium on new payday loan licenses that have been in effect for 10 years (from 2009 – to expire this summer) in Kentucky would now be.
- For now, payday lenders with a currently valid state license are allowed to continue to operate. However, with time, when they expire, they won’t be renewed, and new ones won’t be issued altogether. The new law comes into effect on July 2019.

Database Loan Tracking: No

History of Payday Loans:
Before 1998: – All Mississippi lenders (and the ones that offered small loans as well) had to comply with the 36 % APR usury cap.
1998: – Payday lenders were exempted from this 36 % APR usury cap by the law passed by Mississippi Legislature. In the result, they could charge as much as $21.95 per $100 (for loans of $400 and less).
2003: – Also, 7, 14, and 30-day loan terms were permitted; which resulted in 1144% APR, 572% APR and 267% APR, respectively.
2006: – TheMilitary Lending Acteffectively capped payday loans offered to the military at 36% APR. This federal law has no exceptions, thus, no lender in Mississippi is now allowed to offer loans to the military in excess of 36% APR.
2012: – The sunset provision built into then existing legislation was meant to remove the exemption (of payday lenders from the usury cap) in . It wassupposed to be final: licensed lenders are not able to apply interest rates above 100% under the exemption to Mississippi’s 36% cap on interest, as the exemption expired in .
2012 Check Cash Cashing Act: However, they got thefashioned instead. It made payday lending permanently legal in Mississippi. And it had a tricky loophole that allowed payday lenders to charge triple-digit interest rates. Instead of issuing loans of up to $400 for 30 days, they offered several loans of up to $250 for 14 days each, and by doing so they could get much more in fees. There were numerous attempts to close this loophole in the law, however, all of them failed.
2016: – Besides, instead of restricting the high-cost loan industry, the Mississippi Senate approved installment-loan legislation.
June 2, 2016: – TheConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)proposed aPayday Loan Rulethat hasn’t yet fully come into effect (the federal rule is expected in November 2020).
- However, it is unknown whether the rule will ever come into effect. And it is equally hard to say, provided that it will, whether it will effectively close the loophole for payday lenders in Mississippi, or not.

History of Payday Loans:
1990s: – Many payday lenders had extended loans with rates that exceeded the state of Florida’s 18 percent usury limit. This is regarded as a reflection of the poor state of regulations at the time. (Center for Responsible Lending)
2001: – Florida’s payday loan law, theDeferred Presentment Act, passed. It contained all the current payday loan regulations and was meant to regulate and bring order into the industry. However, as time showed, its practices (meant for the better) failed.
June 2, 2016: – TheConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)proposed aPayday Loan Rulethat hasn’t yet fully come into effect (expected in November 2020).
2018: – Florida’s House and Senate passedthe Deferred Presentment Transactions Law (SB 920)that will allow installment payday loans up to $1,000 repayable in 60 to 90 days (to take effect on July 1, 2019).The need for changes was also caused by thefactthat –$306 million was paid towards fees by Floridians on $3.09 billion borrowed between July 2016 and June 2017. Thus, in the attempt to help consumers, lawmakers decided to offer 3-month installment payday loans apart from the short-term loan product already in place.There is much controversy around this law, however, and many industry opponents say that it will only bring more profit to the lenders and the customers will suffer even more.

History of Payday Loans:
2000s: – Before South Carolina introduced payday loan regulations in 2009,more than 4 million loans a yearwere taken in the state.
2006: – TheMilitary Lending Acteffectively capped payday loans offered to the military at 36% APR. This federal law has no exceptions, thus, no lender in South Carolina is now allowed to offer loans to the military in excess of 36% APR.
2009: – South Carolina Legislation introducedSouth Carolina Deferred Presentment Services Act. It was the first payday loan law that was passed to help regulate the industry. It limited the number of outstanding loans to one, and set a limit of $550 for a loan. Also, it capped financial charges on any given loan.
2010: – However, the success was short-lived as payday lenders in the state promptly found the way to get around the law. The lenders simply abandoned their payday loan licenses and becameshort-term “supervised” lenders. In fact, this loan is very similar to a payday loan, however, it can presuppose collateral (a payday loan does not). Besides, supervised lenders are not subject to payday limitations and regulations. There is no set limit for either the term of a supervised loan or its interest rate. Also, lenders don’t care about checking borrowers via the database. In the result, out of 640 payday lenders that operated in  nearly 100 were re-licensed as supervised lenders. (Alliedprogress.org)
June 2, 2016: – TheConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)proposed aPayday Loan Rulethat hasn’t yet fully come into effect (the federal rule is expected in November 2020).
- However, as the time passes, it seems more unlikely that the rule will ever come into effect. There is no secret thatMick Mulvaney, a former South Carolina Congressman who got agreat deal of support from payday lendersduring his term in the Congress, wasn’t eager to enforce the CFPB’s rule. Neither is Kathy Kraninger, who’s leading it now, for that matter.
- Thus, payday lenders in South Carolina continue to successfully evade state laws and thrive.

1999: – First payday lending laws appeared in Hawaii, when the Legislature passed theCheck Cashing Act (Act 146, Chapter 480F, Hawaii Reversed Statute)that exempted payday lenders from the necessity to comply with 24%  usury cap. Payday lenders got an official name of “deferred deposits”  lenders and started operating in the state.
